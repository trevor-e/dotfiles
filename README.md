## Installation
- Install Homebrew.
- Install Fira Code fonts.
- Create a `~/.local` file containing configurations you don't wish to publish.
- Run `dotfiles.sh`, this will create a symlink in your home directory for each file. It also updates Homebrew.
- Install any themes you like, such as the ones provided here.
